/**
 * In sub01, we stop the thread by setting the flag to be false in the running loop(which is often a while()
 * loop) of the thread.
 * However, this approach can not stop a thread immediately who is blocked (IO blocked, sleep(), synchronize etc.). in
 * sub02, we will show you how to stop a blocked thread. In addition, we will discuss the difference among
 * Thread.interrupt() (= Future.cancel(true)),
 * ExecutorService.shutdown(), ExecutorService.shutdownNow(), ExecutorService.awaitTermination().
 *
 * 1. Let's talking about how to stop blocked thread.
 * By running this example, we find that we can only terminate(or say, interrupt) the SleepBlocked thread (In fact, we can
 * interrupt threads who are blocked by the methods might throw an InterruptedException). But we can not interrupt the
 * IOBlocked thread and SynchronizedBlocked thread by simpling calling Future.cancel(true) or Thread.interrupt().
 *  1.1 In order to stop an IOBlocked Thread, we can close the blocking IO resources of the thread,
 *  	in this example, we can do it like that:
 * 			IOBlocked.in.close();
 * 		but this approach has disadvantage because in.close() may cause the current work can not stop properly. For example,
 * 		if the Thread is writing data to Kafka, and the Kafka client is suddenly close() by your code, you might lost data.
 * 		We will show you how we properly interrupt an IOBlocked Thread in next sub part.
 * 	1.2 It seems that we can not interrupt a SynchronizedBlocked Thread . T_T. But we can interrupt the Thread who is trying
 * 	to get the lock by using the implements of Lock.
 *
 * 2. Thread.interrupt(), ExecutorService.shutdown, ExecutorService.shutdownNow()
 * 	2.1. shutdownNow equals to Thread.interrupt() , or say, shutdownNow based on Thread.interrupt()
 *  , and Future.cancel(true) is also based on Thread.interrupt().
 *  2.2. shutdown and shutdownNow :
 * Once shutdownNow is calledï¼ŒExecutorService will call Future.cancel(true) to all the threads it has.
 * While shutdown will not.
 *  2.3. Thread.interrupt() can not terminate thread immediately, it can only change the
 *  interrupt status of threads, and then break the while(interrupted()) loop of the running thread (if the thread has
 *  such loop)
 *
